### Welcome to my 'tool-shed' equivalent

My name is Paul, I'm currently working my way towards a distinction (fingers-crossed) on the MSc Data Science course at Birkbeck, University of London.

I have a real passion for tinkering, and a career change into Data Science has so far proven to be the best choice of my life. I am an avid creative as well as an eager problem solver, and being able to combine the two is truly amazing.

It is early days, but so far I've been quite drawn towards problem solving with the entire arsenal of machine learning in my grasp. The project on researching feature extraction techniques was quite enjoyable, the versatility of autoencoder architectures is astounding.
I'm very much enjoying digging into the yaw-misalignment problem for wind turbines, developing my own version of outlier detection and removal algorithm. 

This profile is a WIP, but best to have some of my passion here whilst I squeeze the time in outside of studies.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Yaw-misalignment and early fault detection

Loving the challenge in learning how to develop SAAS, apps and other cloud computing related knowledge

I also like to make dreamy 80's inspired synthwave music and plan to eventually make AI to write my music (for fun)
