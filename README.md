### Welcome to my modern day 'tool-shed'

There is nothing like the feeling of encountering a complex puzzle. This is why I love Data Science. I love to find interesting ways to visualise data to reveal hidden insights, and creatively apply my professional knowledge to extract latent value that supports business intelligence, and the development of tech solutions for emerging needs. 

What I offer is very much the core of my personality, and the biggest value I add is in pushing the boundaries of creativity via tech resourcefulness and logical thinking. This can be seen in my work developing an outlier detection solution using computer vision, and in my marketing segmentation work for enhanced service personalisation. 

Data Science is as much a hobby as it is a career, it suits my proclivity for technical work. This same passion led to teaching myself the complex process of sound design and engineering, and equally, my spare time consists of reading article after article from fellow Data Scientists on Medium to find out about interesting ideas. Balancing equalisation to get sounds to poke through a mix is just like fine-tuning regularisation hyperparameters on deep learning models to ensure suitable generalisation that prevents overfitting. 

My passion is how I connect with others, sharing ideas, knowledge and appreciation for other's work. I value the connections I‚Äôve made with my peers, and I‚Äôve made great friends who I learn from, gaining a more diverse perspective. In the future I believe I will make a great mentor and manager, as I have really enjoyed helping those struggling in some subjects I‚Äôve found to have a knack for. 

It is a pleasure to work with people from different backgrounds as it is an opportunity to learn as well as discuss topics I‚Äôm passionate about. This is what I have experienced whilst working on a side project with friends, developing a software as a service application that will inform skaters whether parks will be safe. The end product will utilise meteorological data and predictive modelling, deployed via distributed systems over the cloud. It feels amazing to work in a team where we best utilise our combined expertise towards an objective. 

This is everything I want from life. I‚Äôm not the most extroverted person as an INTJ, but I‚Äôm a huge team player who is incredibly passionate about his craft, and I want to achieve awesome things with equally passionate professionals and make collaborative connections. We are in the 4th industrial revolution, what is more exciting than being a driving force in that??
