Soon to be an MSc Data Science graduate with experience in data management and analysis for an SME charity. Already demonstrated ability in using data to inform decision-making, efficient RDBMS management, and creatively attacking problems using algorithmic design and machine learning. Looking to hit the ground running in an ambitious organisation with tons of opportunities to develop my skills and experience.
